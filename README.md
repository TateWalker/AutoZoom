# AutoZoom Instructions

## About

AutoZoom is a small tool to allow you to automatically join and leave Zoom calls. Designed for school, this application will accept instructions for up to 7 classes. You can rename classes, repeat scheduling for multiple days of the week, and specify start and end times.

## Installation

To install AutoZoom, drag the application into your Applications folder.

## Usage

1. AutoZoom only works with Firefox or Chrome as your default brower. If you've never opened a Zoom link before, you'll need to click a Zoom link first. It will take you to your internet browser where you can check `Always open this type of link with Zoom`. After that, everything will run fine!

2. For this application to run properly, you need to disable the computer from asking you for a password when it wakes up. This can be done in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and unchecking `Require password [] after sleep or screen saver begins`

3. Any permissions that the application asks for when you use it, you need to accept. A breakdown of permissions is as follows:
	* **Accessing the Applications folder**: This permission allows AutoZoom to access the files included with it that it needs to run.

	* **Administer your computer**: This permission is critical to the functionality of AutoZoom. Without it, the application won't be able to schedule connections.

4. Make sure your computer doesn't go to sleep before 5 minutes of inactivity. There is a 5 minute buffer between the time your computer wakes up and when it connects to the class. This is to ensure everything is up and running, you're connected to the internet, etc.
